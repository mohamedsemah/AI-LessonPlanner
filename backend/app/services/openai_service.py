You are an expert instructional designer following Bloom's Taxonomy principles and modern educational research.

LESSON CONTEXT:
Course: {request.course_title}
Topic: {request.lesson_topic}
Level: {request.grade_level}
Duration: {request.duration_minutes} minutes
Preliminary Goals: {request.preliminary_objectives}

PEDAGOGICAL REQUIREMENTS:
Create exactly {total_objectives} learning objectives following these research-based principles:

1. COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY: Limit to {total_objectives} objectives for optimal retention
2. BLOOM'S HIERARCHY: Ensure foundational levels support higher-order thinking
3. SCAFFOLDING: Build complexity progressively
4. CONTEXT APPROPRIATENESS: Match cognitive demand to student level

OBJECTIVE DISTRIBUTION:
{self._format_distribution_guidance(objectives_distribution, selected_levels)}

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Each objective must be specific, measurable, and achievable in {request.duration_minutes} minutes
- Use appropriate cognitive verbs for each Bloom's level
- Include realistic conditions and criteria
- Focus on depth over breadth (Bloom's emphasis on mastery)

COGNITIVE VERBS BY LEVEL:
- Remember: recall, recognize, identify, define, list, name
- Understand: explain, interpret, summarize, classify, compare, discuss
- Apply: implement, demonstrate, solve, use, execute, apply
- Analyze: analyze, examine, compare, differentiate, organize, deconstruct
- Evaluate: evaluate, critique, judge, defend, justify, assess
- Create: create, design, construct, develop, formulate, compose

Return ONLY a JSON array with exactly {total_objectives} objectives (use lowercase for bloom_level):

        - Events 5-6: Active learning and practice (~40-45% of time)  
        - Events 7-9: Assessment and closure (~10-15% of time)

        For EACH of the 9 events, provide:
        1. 2-4 specific, detailed activities appropriate for the time allocated
        2. EXACT duration as specified above (non-negotiable)
        3. Required materials and resources
        4. Assessment strategy (where applicable)

        CONTENT ADAPTATION:
        {"- Focus on hands-on practice, problem-solving, and skill demonstration" if is_practical_focused else "- Focus on knowledge delivery, comprehension, and conceptual understanding"}

        {"- Performance-based assessment throughout" if is_practical_focused else "- Knowledge-based assessment and retention activities"}

        The 9 Events you MUST include:
        1. Gain Attention ({time_distribution[1]} min) - Capture student interest and focus
        2. Inform Learners of Objectives ({time_distribution[2]} min) - Share learning goals clearly
        3. Stimulate Recall of Prior Learning ({time_distribution[3]} min) - Connect to previous knowledge
        4. Present the Content ({time_distribution[4]} min) - Deliver new information systematically
        5. Provide Learning Guidance ({time_distribution[5]} min) - Guide the learning process
        6. Elicit Performance ({time_distribution[6]} min) - Have students practice and demonstrate
        7. Provide Feedback ({time_distribution[7]} min) - Give constructive feedback on performance
        8. Assess Performance ({time_distribution[8]} min) - Evaluate student learning
        9. Enhance Retention and Transfer ({time_distribution[9]} min) - Promote long-term retention

        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with exactly 9 events. Use the EXACT duration specified for each event.
